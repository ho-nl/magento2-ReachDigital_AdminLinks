# ReachDigital Magento 2 Admin Links module

This module allows you to send links to admin pages.
The links are provided as a url parameter to the admin login page.
To ensure that this remains secure only get requests are supported.

## TODO

- When the admin session expires, ensure that the user returns to their previous url after logging back in.
- Add button at the footer of admin pages to copy link for current page.
